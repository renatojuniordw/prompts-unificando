---

### 🎯 PROMPT (EXECUTE ISTO):

```
You are a Full-Stack Next.js Architect specializing in front-backend integration. Analyze the communication layer between frontend and backend.

OBJECTIVE:
Optimize frontend-backend integration for efficiency, type safety, and seamless data flow while maintaining security boundaries.

FULL-STACK INTEGRATION ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

1. API CALL EFFICIENCY: Analyze data fetching patterns.
   - N+1 problems: frontend making multiple API calls that could be consolidated
   - Over-fetching: API returning more data than needed
   - Under-fetching: frontend needing multiple calls to get required data
   - Waterfalls: sequential API calls that could be parallel
   - Unnecessary round trips: data available via getServerSideProps but fetched client-side
   - Polling vs webhooks: inefficient polling patterns
   - For each: call location, issue type, optimization strategy

2. DUPLICATE VALIDATION: Identify validation repeated on both sides.
   - Validation logic in frontend (React hook form, Zod, Yup) duplicated in backend
   - Backend validation but no frontend pre-validation (bad UX)
   - Email validation coded different ways on front vs back
   - Phone, date, custom field validation not shared
   - For each: validation rule, front location, back location, suggested shared approach

3. TYPE SAFETY ACROSS BOUNDARIES: Find type mismatches between layers.
   - TypeScript types not shared between frontend and backend
   - API response types defined twice (frontend expectations vs server reality)
   - Form input types not matching API expectations
   - Type changes in API not reflected in frontend (causes bugs)
   - No type generation from API spec (Swagger, GraphQL)
   - For each: type, mismatch risk, suggested solution (shared types file or generation)

4. DATA TRANSFORMATION: Identify unnecessary data manipulation.
   - Frontend formatting data that should be formatted by backend
   - Backend returning raw data requiring extensive client-side transformation
   - Date formatting, number formatting, enum mapping inconsistently done
   - Database field names exposed to frontend (should map to API contracts)
   - For each: data type, current transformation location, optimization

5. CACHING STRATEGY: Analyze cache usage (browser, HTTP, ISR, SWR).
   - Static pages using getServerSideProps (could use getStaticProps + ISR)
   - API responses not cached (repeated calls for same data)
   - Browser cache headers not set on API responses
   - Stale cache not invalidated after mutations
   - SWR/React Query cache not configured optimally
   - For each: endpoint/page, caching issue, strategy

6. API ROUTE ORGANIZATION: Check API route structure.
   - API routes mixed with page logic (pages/api/ files with rendering code)
   - No API versioning (breaking changes affect all clients)
   - API routes not following REST conventions
   - Missing API documentation
   - Inconsistent request/response formats across endpoints
   - For each: API route, organizational issue, structure improvement

7. ERROR PROPAGATION: Analyze how errors flow from back to front.
   - Backend errors not properly serialized for frontend (lose context)
   - Generic error messages sent to frontend (backend error details not useful)
   - Error types not distinguished (network vs validation vs server error)
   - Error recovery information not sent from backend
   - For each: error scenario, propagation issue, fix

8. REQUEST/RESPONSE CONTRACTS: Identify contract mismatches.
   - Frontend expecting different response format than backend sends
   - Optional vs required fields not documented
   - Enum values different between front (labels) and back (database values)
   - Pagination format inconsistent across API endpoints
   - For each: endpoint, contract issue, suggested standard

9. AUTHENTICATION/AUTHORIZATION FLOW: Analyze security integration.
   - Token refresh logic duplicated
   - CSRF protection not implemented
   - Credentials not sent with requests (withCredentials)
   - Protected API routes not verifying auth properly
   - Role-based access not consistent across endpoints
   - For each: auth scenario, current flow, security improvement

10. GRAPHQL VS REST: If applicable, analyze API design choice.
    - GraphQL over-complexity for simple CRUD operations
    - REST with too many endpoints for related data
    - Query depth/complexity limits not implemented (security risk)
    - DataLoader pattern not used (N+1 queries)
    - For each: endpoint, design assessment, optimization

FULL-STACK OPTIMIZATION PATTERNS:

1. SHARED TYPE DEFINITIONS:
   - Create shared types file (types/api.ts)
   - Use TypeScript to generate types from runtime values
   - Share validation schemas between front/back (Zod, Yup)
   - Document API contracts (OpenAPI/Swagger)

2. API AGGREGATION PATTERN:
   - Consolidate multiple small API calls into single endpoint
   - Use getServerSideProps to fetch all needed data server-side
   - Implement API composition layer

3. CACHE-THEN-NETWORK STRATEGY:
   - SWR/React Query: cache + revalidate
   - HTTP Cache-Control headers on API routes
   - ISR: static generation with periodic revalidation
   - For each: endpoint, appropriate caching strategy

4. OPTIMISTIC UPDATES:
   - Frontend optimistically update UI while request in-flight
   - Rollback if server rejects
   - Maintain consistency between optimistic UI and server state

    - Logs contain sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
    - No centralized error tracking (Sentry, DataDog, etc)
    - Error severity not classified
    - No alerting for critical errors
    - For each: error type, current logging, monitoring setup needed

11. ERROR BOUNDARIES: Check React error isolation.
    - No Error Boundaries (one component error crashes entire page)
    - Error Boundaries not properly scoped
    - Boundary fallback UI not helpful
    - Error Recovery (retry mechanism) not implemented
    - For each: component, boundary protection needed, fallback UI

12. RECOVERY MECHANISMS: Identify missing auto-recovery.
    - Failed requests not retried automatically
    - No exponential backoff on retries (hammers server)
    - Manual retry button not offered to user
    - Failed mutations not rolled back
    - Cache not invalidated on failure
    - For each: scenario, recovery mechanism needed

FULL-STACK ERROR PATTERNS:

1. STANDARDIZED ERROR RESPONSE:
   Backend responds consistently:
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": {
       "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR" | "NOT_FOUND" | "UNAUTHORIZED" | "INTERNAL_ERROR",
       "message": "User-friendly message",
       "details": { "field": "email", "reason": "already_taken" },
       "retryable": true | false
     }
   }

2. ERROR CLASSIFICATION:
   - VALIDATION: user input invalid
   - NOT_FOUND: resource doesn't exist
   - UNAUTHORIZED: user not authenticated
   - FORBIDDEN: user not authorized
   - CONFLICT: state conflict (duplicate, constraint violation)
   - RATE_LIMITED: too many requests
   - INTERNAL_ERROR: server error

3. RETRY STRATEGY:
   - Retryable errors: network, timeout, 429, 5xx
   - Non-retryable: 400, 401, 403, 404
   - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s... (max 60s)
   - Max retries: typically 3-5

4. USER-FACING ERROR MESSAGES:
   - Validation: "Email is already in use. Try another email."
   - Network: "Connection failed. Check your internet and try again."
   - Server: "Something went wrong. Our team has been notified. Please try again in a moment."
   - Unauthorized: "Your session expired. Please log in again."

DELIVERABLE FORMAT:
Full-Stack error handling improvement plan:

BACKEND ERROR HANDLING:
- For each API route:
  - Current error handling: try/catch status
  - Error scenarios: what could fail
  - Error response: format, message
  - Issues: identified gaps
  - Fix: improved implementation
  - Code example: try/catch, error response

FRONTEND ERROR HANDLING:
- For each API integration:
  - Current error handling: .catch() status
  - Error UI: how errors shown to user
  - Error scenarios: network, validation, server
  - Issues: identified gaps
  - Fix: error boundary, error state, retry
  - Code example: safe API call with error handling

ERROR RESPONSE STANDARDIZATION:
- Current: how errors formatted currently
- Standard: recommended error response format
- Implementation: middleware to standardize responses
- Code example: API response wrapper

USER-FACING MESSAGES:
- For each error type:
  - Technical error: what actually happened
  - User message: clear, actionable, helpful
  - Recovery suggestion: what user should do

MONITORING & LOGGING:
- Error tracking: service setup (Sentry, DataDog, etc)
- Logging: what to log, where, how to query
- Alerting: critical errors notified
- Code example: error tracking integration

ERROR RECOVERY:
- Retry strategy: exponential backoff implementation
- Fallback UI: what to show if operation fails
- Graceful degradation: feature unavailable but app works
- Manual recovery: retry button UI

IMPORTANT:
- Don't expose stack traces to users (security)
- Log stack traces on backend (debugging)
- Distinguish error types: network vs validation vs server
- Provide actionable messages: "Email already taken" not "Error"
- Test error scenarios: offline mode, timeouts, server errors
- Monitor continuously: error rates, most common errors
- Set up alerting: critical errors should notify team
```

- 👤 **Sem feedback** (ex: requisição falha, user não sabe se enviou ou não)
- ⛓️ **Promise rejection não tratada** (ex: async função sem catch)
- 🔄 **Sem retry automático** (ex: falha de rede = falha permanente)
- 🛡️ **Sem error boundary** (ex: página inteira quebra com erro em um componente)
- 📝 **Sem logging** (ex: erros desaparecem, impossible debugar em produção)
